# MySQL-Shuffle
Just an example of script for randomizing data in one or more columns.

I was needed script that shuffle data, but not found any good solutions.
 So I created a new one and it's works fast enough, faster than direct
 shuffling/copying of each row.

The advantages of my script are that it does not create duplicates of
 data and moves data only once.

As it just an example of my way to shuffle data, so feel free to
change it as you need. Also I will be glad for each suggested improvement.
